# Radar Target Classification using Deep Learning (MSTAR Dataset)

This project explores deep learning-based classification of ground targets in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images using the MSTAR dataset. It compares a series of models, from classical convolutional networks to transformer-based and hybrid architectures, designed specifically for scenarios with limited data availability.
